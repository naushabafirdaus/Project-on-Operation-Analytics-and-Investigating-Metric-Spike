# Project-on-Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike
Operational Analytics is a necessary process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. The role of a Data Analyst is linked closely with various teams, such as operations, support, and marketing, helping them derive valuable insights from the data they collect.

One of the critical aspects of Operational Analytics is investigating metric spikes. This involves understanding and explaining sudden changes in key metrics, such as a dip in daily user engagement or a drop in sales. As a Data Analyst, it is our job to answer these questions daily, making it crucial to understand how to investigate these metric spikes.



Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

Here, we will be working with a table named job_data with the following columns:

job_id: Unique identifier of jobs
actor_id: Unique identifier of actor
event: The type of event (decision/skip/transfer).
language: The Language of the content
time_spent: Time spent reviewing the job in seconds.
org: The Organization of the actor
ds: The date in the format yyyy/mm/dd (stored as text)




The problems

A)Jobs Reviewed Over Time:
Objective: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.
Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.

B)Throughput Analysis:
Objective: Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second).
Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput. Also, explain why you prefer using the daily metric or the 7-day rolling average for throughput.



C)Language Share Analysis:
Objective: Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.
Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the percentage share of each language over the last 30 days.

D)Duplicate Rows Detection:
Objective: Identify duplicate rows in the data.
Task: Write an SQL query to display duplicate rows from the job_data table.
